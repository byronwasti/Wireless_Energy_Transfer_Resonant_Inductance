# Wireless_Energy_Transfer_Resonant_Inductance
E&amp;M Final project notes and equations and stuff.

## Values to calculate
1. Mutual Inductance
2. Power Lost
3. Power transfered/Power dissipated
Equations at http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/serres.html#c2
4. Resonant frequencies
$w0 = 1/sqrt(LC)$
5. Induced EMF
