# Wireless_Energy_Transfer_Resonant_Inductance
E&amp;M Final project notes and equations and stuff.

## Values to calculate
1. Mutual Inductance
M12 = Flux2/I1
2. Power Lost
Plost = Pdis - Ptran
3. Power transfered
P = I^2R  get I from induced EMF (V = IR)
4. Power dissipated
Equations at http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/serres.html#c2
5.  Resonant frequencies
w0 = 1/sqrt(LC)
6.  Induced EMF
Vmax = k**sqrt(L2/L1)

## Questions for Oscar:
Why does a flat coil reduce the interference from the skin effect? Why can't we use a cylindrical design?

Ask about equation for induced EMF: why does it go to zero when the circuits have similar resonant frequencies?

Ask about circuit components &amp; make sure we aren't missing any pieces
