Near-Field Energy Transfer Using Resonant Inductance
----

### Assumptions
+ Solenoids are perfect cylinders, perfect in general and infinite in length
+ Resonance Equation
```
W_d =  1/ sqrt(LC)
```



### Math We Need to Do

### Comsol Model
+ Two inductors. 
+ Comsol can't do LC circuit simulation

### Project/Proof of Concept
