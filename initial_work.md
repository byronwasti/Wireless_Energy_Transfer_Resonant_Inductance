Near-Field Energy Transfer Using Resonant Inductance
----

### Assumptions
+ Solenoids are perfect cylinders, perfect in general and infinite in length
+ Resonance Equation
```
W_d =  1/ sqrt(LC)
```

### Math We Need to Do
+ Resonance and how it fits into everything
+ Mutual inductance + resonance
```
Emf = -M dI/dt 
```

### Comsol Model
+ Two inductors. 
+ Comsol can't do LC circuit simulation
    +  Wat

### Project/Proof of Concept
+ Two solenoids
+ One driven with variable AC
+ One paired with a capacitor to make a resonant circuit
+ Demoonstrate that resonance increases EMF or potential distance between the two coils.
